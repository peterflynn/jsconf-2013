# JavaScript Performance Tuning Secrets
This is a collection of notes related to my talk on [JavaScript Performance Tuning Secrets](https://github.com/jsconf/jsconfus2013/issues/15)
at [JSConf 2013](http://2013.jsconf.us).

Slides are available in PPT format here: _[JavaScript Performance Secrets.pptx](https://github.com/peterflynn/jsconf-2013/blob/master/JavaScript%20Performance%20Secrets.pptx)_.
The liner notes on each slide have some additional info.
